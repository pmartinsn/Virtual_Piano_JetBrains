# Hyperkill JetBrains Academy - Web Developer Track
## STILL IN PROGRESS


## About
One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of the web application to the keys on the keyboard. The mouse is easy to operate, but it's not enough, because some things are more convenient to do with the keyboard — for example, refresh a page in the browser. It is also very important to make your product available to a variety of users, including those with physical disabilities. People with poor eyesight and/or impaired fine motor skills learn about the content of sites literally through touch. Switching between keyboard and mouse plays a vital role when using programs to sound text on the screen and navigating sites. These programs make the information on the web more accessible for people with disabilities. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, in this project we will make a virtual piano — perhaps this is one of the most creative and enjoyable ways to learn!

## Learning outcomes
Teaches how to write markup HTML documents and practice the most popular CSS properties. Teaches also learn how to use JavaScript to make event handlers for browser events, create and insert new elements into the document. Three useful technologies in a single project!
